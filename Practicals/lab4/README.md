## Factory Design Pattern ##

### What is the Factory Design Pattern ##

Factory Design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass , but allows subclases to alter the type of objects that will be created. 


### When to Use a Factory pattern? ###
- When we don't know ahead of time what class object we need
- When all of the potential classes are in the same subclass hierarchy
- To centralize class selection code
- When we don't want the user to have to know every subclass
- To encapsulate object creation
